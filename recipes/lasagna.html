            <h2>Introduction</h2>
         This delicious lasagna recipe is sure to please everyone in your family. 
         Robust tomato sauce, savory cheeses, and tender pasta bring together a classic dish that will delight the entire table, from the in-laws to the picky eaters! Best of all, this recipe is versatile; any meat (or a vegetarian version with your favorite veggie blend or meat substitute!) will suit the flavors, and won't impact the cook time, as it's prepared separately and added into the sauce before baking. <br> Give this lovely Italian dish a try, and you certainly won't regret it. With just a little bit of preparation beforehand, you can even freeze it and bake it later on in the week. 
         Hello meal prep, goodbye meal-time panic!

<h2>Instructions</h2>
    <ol>
<li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees Farenheit. </li>
 <li>Sautee the protein of choice in a pan over medium heat with oil, onion, and garlic, until the protein is browned and the onions translucent; set aside. </li>
 <li> Combine the egg, ricotta, parsley, some salt, pepper, and dried basil with the parmesan cheese in a bowl, and mix until combined.</li>
 <li>Follow the preparation instructions for your pasta(fresh, dry, or par-cooked, the choice is yours), and set aside.</li>
 <li> Combine the browned protein from before with your tomato products, and mix in the fennel seed, salt, pepper, and italian seasoning. Stir in the pan on medium heat until simmering, about ten minutes.</li>
 <li> Layer some of the tomato sauce mixture on the bottom of a casserole dish, followed by strips of pasta until that is covered; add a layer of ricotta, then another layer of pasta. Repeat from the first layer until you reach the top of the dish or run out of ingredients, whatever comes first. Ideally end with ricotta or meat. </li>
 <li>Top the lasagna with your Mozzarella and more of the parmesan, and place it, covered, in the oven to bake for 30 minutes.</li>
 <li>Remove the cover, and bake for ten more. </li>
 <li>Let it rest on the counter for ten minutes before serving.</li>
