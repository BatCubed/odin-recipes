        <h1>Nana's Famous Meatloaf</h1>
            <img src="../images/meatloaf.jpg">
        <h3>Introduction</h3>
            Ah, meatloaf. A classic dish that fills the whole house with the smell of tomatoes, sweet onions, and savory beef.  Many of us have fond memories of coming home to a freshly-baked meatloaf and mashed potatoes, finished off with roasted vegetables to cut through the carbs and protein. 
            <br> This classic recipe was passed down to me by my grandmother, and the key to a perfect meatloaf just like hers is draining the grease off every half hour while it cooks low and slow, and refreshing the ketchup topping every so often so it doesn't get too dry. 
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>3 lbs. Ground Beef</li>
                <li>1 Small Onion</li>
                <li> Plain Bread Crumbs (Gluten free bread crumbs or panko are acceptable as well!) </li>
                <li> 1-2 Eggs</li>
                <li> Ketchup</li>
                <li>Worcestershire Sauce</li>
                <li>"Heinz 57" Steak Sauce</li>
                <strong>Spices</strong>
                <ul> <li>Onion Powder</li> <li>Garlic Powder</li> <li>Salt & Pepper</li>
                </ul>
            </ul>
        <h3>Instructions</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Preheat your oven to 350 degrees Farenheit. Ensure that the ground beef is fully thawed before beginning; dice onion into small pieces, and add it and the beef to a mixing bowl.</li>
                <li> Add a cup to two cups of bread crumbs to the meat, as well as a generous portion of each of your spices.</li>
                <li> Crack an egg into the bowl, as well as a tablespoon of ketchup, worcestershire sauce, and steak sauce; mix well, with a utensil of choice or by hand. From here, use your own judgment to determine whether the meat mixture needs more liquids (sauces, or even another egg,) or if it needs more bread crumbs. Similar to making meatballs, it should stick to itself well without dripping, but should also be a consistent color, without patches of bare meat. Make any adjustments necessary. </li>
                <li>Mold the meat to your dish of choice, ideally deep and rectangular, although the specific shape doesn't matter much.</li>
                <li>Mix together 1/2 cup ketchup with a some dashes of worcestershire sauce. The mixture should be a red-brown color. Spread this mixture on the top of the meatloaf until covered, and set aside any extra to use later.</li>
                <li>Cover with aluminum foil, and bake for 30 minutes at a time, for a total of about two hours. Every half hour, remove from the oven, take off the foil, and drain off the grease carefully, supporting the meat with a spatula if necessary. If the ketchup mixture on the top appears too dry, slather more on the top before covering again and returning it to the oven. (Note: if you run out of the mixture and don't want to make more, squeezing ketchup directly onto the top of the meatloaf is also acceptable.</li>
                <li> You will know it's finished when the meatloaf has a dark brown crust around it, and the ketchup mixture has darkened and baked into it. </li>
                <li> If you choose to, remove it from the pan and serve it from a plate; either way, let it rest ten to fifteen minutes at room temperature before slicing it into pieces and serving. </li>
            </ol>

            Enjoy this lovely meatloaf recipe with your favorite side dishes! I recommend macaroni and cheese, roasted or mashed potatoes, and roasted vegetables tossed in grapeseed oil, salt, and pepper.
